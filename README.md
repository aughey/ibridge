# iBridge - Bridge two networks with a web browser

## Summary

iBridge uses a web browser to bridge together two networks
without the need for operating system support.  One use case
for this software is to use a smart phone device to temporarily
tether a desktop computer to the internet.  Another use case is
to tunnel through a proxy server to access the public internet.
This can all be done without jail-breaking a device or administrative
access to a computer.

> Note: Be sure to follow usage policies on your respective networks.
